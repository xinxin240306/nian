"""TTS orchestration: pick an engine, synthesise, encode, and push.

The orchestrator is the glue between the ``say`` MCP tool (defined in
:mod:`stackchan_mcp.stdio_server`) and the engine implementations
registered in :mod:`stackchan_mcp.tts`. It validates arguments, looks
up an engine, runs the synthesis, encodes the result to Opus, and
hands the frames off to :mod:`stackchan_mcp.audio_stream` for delivery.

The framework half (Engine ABC, registry, validation surface) shipped
in PR1 of Issue #70; PR2 wires the actual VOICEVOX → PCM → Opus →
WebSocket pipeline. The signature stays back-compatible with PR1's
tests: ``gateway`` is keyword-only and may be omitted, in which case
calls that pass validation surface a clear error instead of silently
synthesising audio with no destination.
